# What is this project?

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It works with Jasmine (http://jasmine.github.io/), and it's part of the Google Udacity Front-End Development Scolarship. 
Through this project, I emphasize the true meaning of testing and how important it is in front-end development.

## How do I open it?

You don't have to install the application.
Find the index.html file and open it into your favorite browser. The application will display automatically.

## What should I see?

Jasmine is an application meant for testing, so if you scroll to the bottom of the page, you will see those tests.
The tests should specify:
- 7 specs
- 0 failures

If the background is green, then the application is error-free. The application works well.
If the background is red, that means you have to check the specified errors and turn them to green.
